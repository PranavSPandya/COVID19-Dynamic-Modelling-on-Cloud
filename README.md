# COVID19-Dynamic-Modelling-on-Cloud
I am creating a dynamic model for understanding the impact of COVID19 Crisis on Human Resource and Economy dynamically to ensure uptodate information at various levels.

I will address the local and regional level factors which are contributing to the increasing COVID19 Cases and those factors are the underlying issues which are susseptible to diseases. These factors need to be addressed and will require a Multivariate Analysis Framework for figuring out which factors are inherently dependent and independent varaibles of the study.
